# A-novel-frequency-direction-post-processing-method
The corresponding paper, A Frequency-Direction Post-Processing Method for Improving Energy Concentration and Signal Reconstruction, has been submitted to ICASSP. A portion of the source code has been made available on the MathWorks Community and GitHub. Full access to all source code will be made available upon the acceptance of this paper.

The current version of this MATLAB code demonstrates key limitations of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
